# RenovateBot PR Impact Analysis

[Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com) PR Impact Agent is a Kagent based GitHub agent that automatically analyzes Renovate-generated pull requests and posts a concise, security-aware summary of dependency updates directly on the PR.

It helps reviewers quickly understand what changed, why it matters, and whether any action is required—without digging through release notes. That's the pain problem that I'm trying to solve.
