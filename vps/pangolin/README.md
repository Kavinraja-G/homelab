# Pangolin Control plane

Before running the docker-compose install with:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pangolin.net/get-installer.sh | bash

sudo ./installer
```

Above can be skipped, just move forward with the `docker compose up` following the [docs](https://docs.pangolin.net/self-host/manual/docker-compose).
